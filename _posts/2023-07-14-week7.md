For my seventh week, I got started on my final presentation that I would presenting on the July 28th and July 31st. I also started testing parameter tuning for the reservoir and seeing what the effects would be. I found out that increasing the reservoir size and setting the spectral radius to 1 greatly improved the training MSE. However, it also caused overfitting for the testing MSE. Because of this, I added a regularization parameter which fixed the issues with overfitting and yieled good results. I also tested using preprocessing such as PCA and testing different training layers. Overall, MLP performed the best out of linear regression and SVM. Also having PCA decreased the MSE.
