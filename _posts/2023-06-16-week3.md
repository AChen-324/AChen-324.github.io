title: Week 3

For my third week, I learned in-depth of what my project entails. Essentially, the end goal is to be able to implement reservoir computing using bio-physical hardware. To achieve this goal, the lab I am working in has already created a simulator known as the MiV simulator. However, before using this simulator, my goal is to implement reservoir computing using Nengo which a neural simulator. Testing different reservoir computing models in Nengo will act as another layer of evaluation in comparison to the MiV simulator and will help the lab learn more about how reservoir computing would fair in a bio-physical setting. 

Thus, this week I was mainly going through tutorials and documentation of Nengo so that I can get started on this process. In addition, I continued to read through articles about reservoir computing.
