title: Week 8

For my eigth week, I learned about the MiV simulator which is the simulator that my group uses to do large biophysical neuron simulations. I then set up docker to set up the simulator on my device and read through the MiV simulator documentation. I learned that the MiV simulator only accept spike train data. Because of this, I looked into how to encode inputs into spike trains. I then decided to compare my reservoir computing Nengo model to a baseline. My baseline was just performing linear regression on the input. During this process, I realized there were architectural mistakes with my current reservoir. I then spent the rest of the week fixing the reservoir.
