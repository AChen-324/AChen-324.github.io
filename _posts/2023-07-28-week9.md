title: Week 9
---

For my ninth week, I managed to fix the reservoir structure. I then had to redo the tests that I had done in the previous weeks using the new reservoir. However, I had to finish up my poster at the same time so I only tested using sin data and I mainly focused on testing reservoir parameters such as reservoir size and spectral radius. During this week, I also finished my presentation, my abstract, and started plotting next steps for reservoir testing. At the end of the week I presented my poster within my lab group.
