title: Week 2

For my second week, I actually tried to implement reservoir computing. Using an example dataset (number of airplane passengers over the course of 12 years), I trained the dataset to forcast the number of passengers. I learned how to preprocess a temporal dataset, how to construct a reservoir, and how to train the resulting output of the reservoir using ridge regression. I also spent a large portion of the week reading articles on reservoir computing.
