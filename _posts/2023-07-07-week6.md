For my sixth week, I took my Nengo reservoir I tried to integrate it into my team's reservoir_computing repository. I had to make my code modular and eventually got it set up for airplane data and my Nengo reservoir. From there, I tested using just a sine input to make sure that the reservoir worked on simple inputs. Then, I looked through the literature to see what layers, architectures, and parameters were good to test with my new Nengo model. I wrote up a list of things I would want to test and started setting up modules for them in the reservoir_computing repository. By the end of the week, I made SVM and MLP training layers. I also made PCA and encoder preprocessing classes.
