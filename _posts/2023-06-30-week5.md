For my fifth week, I started constructing a reservoir using Nengo. I managed to set up a working reservoir. Then, I had set up the airplane data so that I could use it with the Nengo reservoir. Finally, I started doing a few tests with the Nengo reservoir and airplane data. I tested the effects of preprocessing the airplane data vs. leaving the airplane data unprocessed. Nengo also has a method called solvers that I tested against using ridge regression directly. Overall, preprocessing the data and using ridge regression directly yielded better results.
